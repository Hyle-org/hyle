# Contributing

We are an open-source project and we welcome contributions.

Weâ€™re always happy to talk and answer questions and remarks in [our Telegram group](https://t.me/hyle_org). Please discuss major changes with us in an issue before submitting a PR.

## **Guidelines**

- Keep PRs focused and well-documented.
- Follow our existing structure and style.
- Keep conversations focused, useful, and respectful.
- Use a [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) at the beginning of your PR title.

## Payments

**We do not provide financial rewards for contributions.**

The exception is online hackathons with OnlyDust: [find all of these issues in our Hackathons repository](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hackathons) and they are usually tagged for a specific event.
