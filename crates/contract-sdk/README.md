# Hyle contract SDK

In this crate you will find some helpers function to build your Smart Contract on Hyle.

ðŸš§ This is work in progress, all of this is subject to changes. See [examples](https://github.com/Hyle-org/examples) for usages.

# Model

Some of the models are defined in `hyle-model` crates, which is re-exported by this crate.

For example, you can do either of these two:
```rust 
use contract_sdk::ContractInput;
// or 
use hyle_model::ContractInput;
```

It allows you to only depends on crate `contract-sdk` in your contract's code.


# Entrypoints

The inputs of the zkVM should be of type ContractInput defined in
```rust
pub struct ContractInput {
    pub state: Vec<u8>,
    pub identity: Identity,
    pub tx_hash: TxHash,
    pub private_blob: BlobData,
    pub blobs: Vec<Blob>,
    pub index: BlobIndex,
}
```

In `guest.rs` you will find 2 functions that are entry points of smart contracts. You should call at least one of them at the beginning of your contract.

```rust 
pub fn init_raw<Action>(input: ContractInput) -> (ContractInput, Action)

pub fn init_with_caller<Action>(
    input: ContractInput,
) -> Result<(ContractInput, StructuredBlob<Action>, Identity), String>
```

At the end of your contract, you need to output a `HyleOutput`, you can use the helper in `utils.rs`:

```rust
pub fn as_hyle_output<State>(
    input: ContractInput,
    new_state: State,
    res: crate::RunResult,
) -> HyleOutput
```

# Helpers 

You can find in `erc20.rs` and `identity_prover.rs` some structs & traits used to help building contracts of token transfers & identity providing. 
These are only helpers to build new contracts, not required standards.
