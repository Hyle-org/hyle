# Fees in hyle
A proposal on how to handle fees on hyle

We assume some smart contracts existing from genesis block:
- `hyfi` to gather fees 
- `hydentity` to check identity

We assume a smart contract exists from genesis block to handle fees. We call it `hyfi`.
We consider a global account we call `network`, this is where users will send fees, and this account will be distributed among consensus validators.

## Fees verification

*tldr*: Fees are checked *before* data dissemination, the node has to be sure that the network will be able to get the fees.

A Blob Transaction is:

```rust
pub struct BlobTransaction {
    pub identity: Identity,
    pub blobs: Vec<Blob>,
}
```

When a new transaction is sent to the node, it checks if:

- there is a blob for contract `hydentity` & identity is valid
- there is a blob for contract `hyfi`
- this is a token transfert from `identity` to `network`
- the token transfer is **valid**
    - meaning that `identity` has enough balance

If all those are valid, the node knows it will be able to generate a proof for this blob and gather the fees.

:mag: We can "execute" the `hyfi` & `hydentity` smart contract code itself to check the output without proving it now.

If the transaction is valid, it can be sent to mempool for data dissemination.

:question: Should each node do this verification when receiving the tx in data dissemination ? If we don't, the network might accept transactions with no fees if a node "don't care" about fees in its data lane.

:question: How to check balances with unsettled transactions ?
 
:question: How to take fees on blobs that canâ€™t be prooved ?

:question: Fees are present in blob transaction, so they should pay for the proof transaction, which is the costly part. How can we anticipate the "cost" of the proof before having it, only with the blobs ?


## Fees gathering

Once the blob transaction is sequenced in a block, any node can generate the ProofTransaction for all fees blobs in the previous block, and once 
this one is disseminated & included in a block, all fees will be effectively moved to the `network` account.

```rust
pub struct ProofTransaction {
    pub blobs_references: Vec<BlobReference>,
    pub proof: Vec<u8>,
}
```

## Fees distribution

Once fees blobs are settled, some funds are "locked" in the contract and can be distributed among validators that took part of the consensus. It does not need to be done at each block, it can be "delayed".
Whenever a node wants to take its profits, it can execute & proof the call of a function `distribute` on the contract `hyfi`. 

This function takes as input `validator_rates`: a list of validators, and a rate for each one, depending on how much it participated to the consensus since the last distribution.

This blob transaction needs to be checked by the consensus, to verify that the list `validator_rates` is valid, if not, the transaction should not be included in a bloc and the proposal rejected.

:question: Can we do this verification somewhere else ? It is mandatory that no one "sneaky" distribute fees with invalid list of validators rates.
