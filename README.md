_A sequencing and settlement layer to help you build provable apps that are minimally, yet sufficiently, on-chain._

This repository hosts the **work-in-progress Rust client** for the [Hyl√©](https://hyle.eu) chain.  
The older, but still maintained, Cosmos SDK-based client can be found at [hyle-cosmos](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle-cosmos).

**Current Status**: üöß Work in Progress (WIP)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### With Cargo

#### Start a Single-Node Devnet

To launch a single-node devnet (consensus disabled) for building and debugging smart contracts:

```bash
cargo build
HYLE_RUN_INDEXER=false cargo run --bin node
```

#### Run with Indexer

To enable the indexer, ensure you have a running PostgreSQL server:

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL with default configuration:
docker run -d --rm --name pg_hyle -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres
```

### Configuration

You can configure Hyl√© using environment variables or a configuration file:

#### Using a Configuration File

Copy the default configuration file to the directory where the node will run:

```bash
cp ./src/utils/conf_defaults.ron config.ron
```

If a file named `config.ron` is present, it will be automatically loaded at node startup.

#### Using Environment Variables

Examples of configuration via environment variables:

```bash
HYLE_RUN_INDEXER=false 
HYLE_CONSENSUS__SLOT_DURATION=100
```

### Interact with the Node

You can interact with the node using the CLI tool `hyled`:

```bash
cargo run --bin hyled -- --help
```

To install it for easier access:

```bash
cargo install --path . --bin hyled
hyled --help
```

## üê≥ Getting Started with Docker

### Build Locally

```bash
docker build . -t hyle
```

### Run Locally with Docker

```bash
docker run -v ./db:/hyle/data -e HYLE_RUN_INDEXER=false -p 4321:4321 -p 1234:1234 hyle
```

> üõ†Ô∏è **Note**: If you encounter permission issues with the `/hyle/data` volume, add the `--privileged` flag.

---

## üìä Monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus

### Starting Services

To start the monitoring stack:

```bash
docker compose -f tools/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Access Grafana

Grafana is accessible at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Stopping Services

To stop the monitoring stack:

```bash
docker compose -f tools/docker-compose.yml down
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Profiling and Debugging

### Profiling Build

Run the following command to enable the `profiling` profile, which is optimised but retains debug symbols:

```bash
cargo run --profile profiling
```

### CPU Profiling

- Use `tokio-console` for basic debugging.
- For advanced analysis, we recommend [Samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply).

### Memory Profiling

Hyl√© includes built-in support for the `dhat` crate, which uses the Valgrind DHAT viewer for memory profiling.  
To enable this feature, add the `dhat` feature flag. Use it selectively, as it has a runtime performance cost.
