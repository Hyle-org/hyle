_Hyli is the new proof-powered L1 to build the next generation of apps onchain._

This repository hosts the **work-in-progress Rust client** for the [Hyli](https://hyli.org) chain.

**Current Status**: üöß Work in Progress (WIP)

## üöÄ Getting Started

For a single-node devnet (consensus disabled) with an indexer, clone the hyli repository and run:

```sh
cargo run -- --pg
```

This command starts a temporary PostgreSQL server and erases its data when you stop the node.

For alternative setups, optional features, and advanced configurations, check out the [devnet reference page](https://docs.hyli.org/reference/devnet/).

To write and deploy apps on the devnet, look at [our quickstart guide](https://docs.hyli.org/quickstart/)!

## üìä Monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus

### Starting Services

To start the monitoring stack:

```bash
docker compose -f tools/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Access Grafana

Grafana is accessible at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Stopping Services

To stop the monitoring stack:

```bash
docker compose -f tools/docker-compose.yml down
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Profiling and Debugging

### Profiling Build

Run the following command to enable the `profiling` profile, which is optimised but retains debug symbols:

```bash
cargo run --profile profiling
```

### CPU Profiling

- For advanced analysis, we recommend [Samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply).

### Memory Profiling

Hyli includes built-in support for the `dhat` crate, which uses the Valgrind DHAT viewer for memory profiling.  
To enable this feature, add the `dhat` feature flag. Use it selectively, as it has a runtime performance cost.
